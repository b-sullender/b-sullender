## About Me

Full-Stack Developer | Web-Enthusiast | Server Administrator

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with over a decade of hobbyist programming experience. Recently, I've been delving into the exciting world of web technologies, exploring HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I made the transition from Windows to Linux in 2023.

- I'm currently working on improving my web development skills by creating interactive and user-friendly web applications.
- Ask me about C/C++ programming, algorithms, data structures, and my journey into web development.
- Reach me via [b.sullender@gmail.com](mailto:b.sullender@gmail.com).

## Projects

- ðŸš€ Check out some of my projects that showcase my C/C++ prowess and evolving web development skills:
  - [Debian Setup Scripts](https://github.com/b-sullender/debian-setup): Scripts and a manual for setting up a Debian workstation.
  - [MD View](https://github.com/b-sullender/mdview): Preview Markdown files in your web browser directly from GNOME Nautilus with a simple right-click.
  - [Expression Parser](https://github.com/b-sullender/expression-parser): An expression parser in C that can easily be modified for more operations or turned into a calculator or programming language.
  - [URL Parser](https://github.com/b-sullender/url-parser): A portable URL parser in C.
  - [Blend Pixels](https://github.com/b-sullender/blend-pixels): Shows how to accurately blend 2 BGRA pixels, using a user-defined alpha input, resulting in a final BGRA pixel.
  - [Linux Auth](https://github.com/b-sullender/linux-auth): A lightweight C program for Linux user authentication using the shadow file.
  - [CAPI](https://github.com/b-sullender/CAPI): Abandoned library for graphics, C/C++ strings, and general back-end API. This large code-base is originally from my now abandoned hobbyist OS.

## Goals

- Contribute to open-source projects that align with my interests and expertise.
- Keep learning and growing as a developer by exploring new technologies and best practices.
